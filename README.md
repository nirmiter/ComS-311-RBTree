# ComS-311-RBTree
Assignment to store information in a Red Black Tree and develop algorithms to minimize running time.

The concept of this assignment was to ensure that we were creating algorithms that truly minimized the time taken to update 
values in the tree, and to still maintain accuracy whilst doing so. You use the RBTree by feeding it "Intervals" which are two endpoints
with any given values. From here it maintains the data structure by percolating information/updating variables up through the tree, 
so that this happens in x log n time, where x is a given integer as opposed to polynomial time.
